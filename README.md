# ðŸŽž Digital Image Processing ( In-Progress )

Image loader library to fast load images, it will be optimized for render engines, image processing and more...

It will provide lot of options, wait until first release. 

It will try to support **vector**, **raster** and **raw** images as possible it can be, iternally or with extension library/libraries...

Companion Libaries:

- [filt](https://github.com/recp/filt) - Image filter
- [vision](https://github.com/recp/vision) - Computer vision
